# Euphoria

A Modern Bulletin Board System Built on Synchronet.

# Setup

## Cutting Edge 
1. `mkdir ~/euphoria ; cd ~/euphoria`
2. `wget https://github.com/thoughtpivot/euphoria/archive/master.tar.gz`
3. `tar -xvf master.tar.gz ; rm master.tar.gz`
4. `mv euphoria-master/* . ; rm -rf euphoria-master/`
4. `./Makefile.sh`

Start Euphoria

If running on non-privileged ports.
  ./euphoria.sh

Otherwise, for privileged ports such as 80, 22, 23 and 24 you'll need sudo privileges.
  sudo ./euphoria.sh

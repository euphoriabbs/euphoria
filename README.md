# Euphoria

A Modern Bulletin Board System Built on Synchronet.

# Setup

## Cutting Edge 
1. `mkdir ~/euphoria ; cd ~/euphoria`
2. `wget https://github.com/thoughtpivot/euphoria/archive/master.tar.gz`
3. `tar -xvf master.tar.gz ; rm master.tar.gz`
4. `mv euphoria-master/* . ; rm -rf euphoria-master/`
4. `./Makefile.sh`

Start Euphoria

If running on non standar ports...
  ./euphoria.sh

Otherwise, for standard ports such as 80, 22, 23 and 24 you'll need sudo privileges.
  sudo ./euphoria.sh
  
## Stable
We don't have any just. But we're working on it.

# Supported Operating Systems
1. Most UNIX variants.
2. Most flavors of Linux.
3. Mac OSX in most cases.
4. Windows? No. But some day.
